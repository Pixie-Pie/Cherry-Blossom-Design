## Purpose of Cherry Blossom Design
I created this website because I am extremely interested in interior design, blueprints, and architecture. The purpose of this website is as follows: This website was created to showcase the work of a fictional interior designer named Cherry Blossom, who resides in Santa Barbara, California, USA. The primary goal of this website is to display her most significant interior design projects, attracting a new client base, promoting her work, and introducing her to potential clients. 

Additionally, it serves as an easy means for potential clients to contact her via messages, email, social media platforms, or WhatsApp messages.

This is the first website I have ever created, and it represents my initial project for the Software Development Diploma at The Code Institute.
The project requirements included creating a static and responsive website with multiple sections, a navigation bar, a contact form, and a footer using HTML and CSS.

## UX
The website is presented in a minimalistic and effective manner, offering all essential information on a single page. The navigation bar is user-friendly, providing easy access to key sections, including the About Me, Gallery, and Contact Me sections, which I believe are the most crucial elements of any website.

### Colour Scheme
- `#FFFFFF` (white) was consistently used throughout the website. It served as the font colour for the navigation bar, as well as the background colour for the hero section, about me section, and contact section of the website. Additionally, it was utilized as the background colour for the 'thank you' page that appears after submitting your information via the form.
- `#473C38` was used as the font colour below the hero image and as the colour of the navigation bar.
- `#DADDDE` was used as the background color for both welcome section  and the footer.
- `#000000` was the main font colour used across the different sections of the website, and it was also the colour of the icons in the footer.
- `#E6E5E1` was used as the background colour for the gallery section. 
- `#6B1C02`was used a the colour of the signature under the picture of Cherry Blossom.
